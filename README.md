## Game Flow

The UHC game follows this state machine:

```
IDLE → PRESTARTED → SCATTERING → SCATTERED → STARTED → PVP → MEETUP → FINALIZED
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **IDLE** | No game is running. Server is in lobby mode. |
| **PRESTARTED** | Game is about to start. Players are gathered, countdown begins. |
| **SCATTERING** | Players are being scattered to random locations. |
| **SCATTERED** | All players scattered. Waiting for scatter to complete. |
| **STARTED** | Game is active. Players can explore and gather resources. |
| **PVP** | PvP is enabled. Players can fight each other. |
| **MEETUP** | Border shrinks to meetup size. Final phase begins. |
| **FINALIZED** | Game over. Winner declared. |

### Game Timers

- **PvP Timer**: 15 minutes (configurable) after STARTED before PvP enables
- **Meetup Timer**: 15 minutes (configurable) after PvP starts before border shrinks
- **Final Heal**: 0 minutes (configurable) — grace period before PvP

### Events

The game uses an event system driven by `GameEvent` and `GameTimer`:

- **PvPStartEvent**: Fires when PvP is enabled
- **MeetupStartEvent**: Fires when Meetup begins
- **UHCDeathEvent**: Fires when a player dies during the game
